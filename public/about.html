<h1>About Mike</h1>
<p>I grew up in Ridgewood, New Jersey and currently still reside in Bergen County. I graduated from Ridgewood High School and got my degree from Rutgers University- New Brunswick.</p>

<p>After graduation I pursued a career as a Golf Professional-- spending time as an Assistant at Crystal Springs Resort in New Jersey and The Saint Andrew's Golf Club in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York. I have always loved technology ever since
  early Web Development courses back in the late 90's. I will always love golf, but I hope to transition to a career building websites and web applications. Perhaps I could even mix the two of them together down the line!
</p>

<p>I am currently taking courses to sharpen my skills and then I hope to start crafting personal websites to demonstrate my skills and build my portfolio. I continue to strive to learn
  as much as possible and become an accomplished web developer. I am grateful for any opportunities to demonstrate my desires and capabilities to provide clients with well designed websites and web applications that 
meet their needs. </p>
