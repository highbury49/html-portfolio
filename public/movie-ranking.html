<h1>The Best Movies According to Mike</h1>
 <h2>My Top 5 Movies of all Time</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Casino:</h3>
 <p>An enthralling mafia/crime driven thriller full of intrigue and standout performances. DeNiro, Stone and Pesci at their best in this tale of the rise of organized crime in Las Vegas.</p>
 <h3>Star Wars Episode II- The Empire Strikes Back:</h3>
 <p>The second act in the Original Trilogy. The joy from the conclusion of A New Hope is quickly extinguished in this epic sci-fi drama that left so many questions heading into Return of the Jedi.</p>
<h3>Die Hard:</h3>
<p>Yes this is a Christmas Movie. It takes place during a Christmas Party! This initial installment of the Die Hard series is an all time classic. It is an action packed suspense thriller of the highest order while maintaining a light hearted comedic charm throughout. One of the great movies of the 1980's that introduced us to incredibly loved characters.</p>
<h3>Demolition Man:</h3>
<p>A criminally underrated film. Stallone and Snipes put on performances for the ages. A strange dystopian society is the perfect setting for this film. It's one of the truly underappreciated films of this time period where so many other great films were being released around it. It funnily has so many similarities to society today in some respects.</p>
<h3>Oceans Eleven:</h3>
<p>An incredible film on all levels. A star studded cast that did not disappoint. A fun and engaging film that is incredibly re-watchable. On a long list of great heist films this is certainly near the top. </p>
